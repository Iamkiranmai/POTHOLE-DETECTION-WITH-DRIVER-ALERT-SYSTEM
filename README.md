# POTHOLE DETECTION WITH DRIVER ALERT SYSTEM

## Overview

This project implements a real-time pothole detection system using **YOLOv8 with instance segmentation** and provides an alert mechanism through a **buzzer** when potholes are identified.  
It is aimed at improving road safety by helping drivers avoid potholes, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and vehicle damage.

## Features

- Accurate pothole detection using YOLOv8 segmentation  
- Custom-trained model on a manually annotated dataset  
- Real-time video analysis using OpenCV  
- Audio alert system (buzzer) triggered on pothole detection  
- Efficient filtering of false detections based on confidence, area, and shape

## Project Overview

### 📌 Dataset Preparation
- Extracted frames from a recorded road video (`p.mp4`)
- Annotated potholes using Roboflow’s polygon tool
- Exported dataset in YOLOv8 format

### 📌 Model Training
- Trained the YOLOv8 segmentation model using Google Colab with GPU acceleration
- Saved the trained model as `best.pt` after 50+ epochs of training

### 📌 Real-Time Detection with Alert
- Developed `test.py` script to:
  - Load video frame-by-frame
  - Run model predictions
  - Validate detections
  - Display results and trigger buzzer alert using threading

├── p.mp4                  # Test video
├── buzz.mp3               # Buzzer alert sound
├── test.py                # Main detection and alert script

## How to Run

### Clone the repository:
gh repo clone deekshitha68/POTHOLE-DETECTION-WITH-DRIVER-ALERT-SYSTEM
cd POTHOLE-DETECTION-WITH-DRIVER-ALERT-SYSTEM


### Install dependencies:


pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy


### Make sure the following files are in the same folder:

* `best.pt` – trained model
* `p.mp4` – input video
* `buzz.mp3` – alert sound

### Run the detection:


python test.py


Press `q` to stop the video display.


## Output

The system will display the video with potholes highlighted.

If a pothole is detected and validated, a buzzer sound will be played.

Detection is real-time with visual and audio feedback.

## Possible Extensions

* Integrate with live camera feed (e.g., mounted on a vehicle)
* Deploy on Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson for field use
* Add GPS location logging of detected potholes
* Send alerts to road maintenance authorities or cloud dashboards
